    Solve SAT problem using greedy heuristic with frequency-based variable selection.
    
    This greedy solver uses a simple but effective strategy:
    1. Select unassigned variable appearing most frequently in unsatisfied clauses
    2. Choose polarity that satisfies the most currently unsatisfied clauses  
    3. Apply unit propagation to infer additional assignments
    4. Repeat until all clauses satisfied or conflict detected
    
    Args:
        task_data (SATTask): SAT instance containing CNF formula
        max_iterations (int): Maximum number of variable assignment iterations
        
    Returns:
        None: Solution stored directly in task_data.solution
        
    Algorithm Details:
        - Variable selection: frequency count in unsatisfied clauses
        - Polarity selection: maximize newly satisfied clauses
        - Propagation: unit clause detection and forced assignments
        - Termination: all clauses satisfied or no progress possible
